# Tanzu Platform for Cloud-Foundry automated install

I have created a new and improved installation script which can be found at https://github.com/KeithRichardLee/Tanzu-GenAI-Platform-installer. This has many enhacements such as requires less parameters, performs validation of all the inputs, improved logging, works cross-platforms, and more.

The orginal script can be found here in this repo in the [v1 branch](https://github.com/KeithRichardLee/Tanzu-Platform-for-Cloud-Foundry-automated-install/tree/v1)
